## Git Basics

A **repository** is a directory containing folders and files in which we store our code. Repositories can be either local or remote. Remote repositories are often stored on hosting websites such as GitHub.

Files in our local repository can be in one of three states:

* Unstaged
* Staged
* Committed

Git is a **version control system**, which means it is software that allows members of a development team to make and keep track of changes to a software project remotely.

Some commonly used **git commands** are:
* git add
* git commit -m "commit message here"
* git push

In practice, actual developer workflows are more complicated than this, but the basic idea is "Add, push, commit". This is how code gets from our local machine into a remote repository.
